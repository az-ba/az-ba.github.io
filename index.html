Hello, I'm Azba! <br><br>

I'm interested in how technology can play a role in creating social impact. <br><br>

I'm currently studying computer science, cultural anthropology, and entrepreneurship at the University of Michigan.
I've built a <a href = "/projects">a few things</a>. 
I love <a href = "http://azba.vsco.co">photography</a> and film, travel, tennis, plants, emojis, and mangoes.
